Given a Matrix A, 
Create a row vector of 1's that has same number of elements as A has rows. 
Create a column vector of 1's that has the same number of elements as A has columns. 
Using matrix multiplication, assign the product of the row vector, the matrix A, and the column vector (in this order) to the variable result. 
A = [1:5; 6:10; 11:15; 16:20];


Ans:
A = [1:5; 6:10; 11:15; 16:20];
R_vector = ones(1,size(A,1));
C_vector=ones(size(A,2),1);
result = R_vector*A*C_vector;
